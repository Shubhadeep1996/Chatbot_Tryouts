Hello, This a basic chatbot model for just testing purpose

Chatbot is a autonomous body which is made with ML and AI. Chatbots are not a recent development. 
They are simulations which can understand human language, process it and interact back with humans while performing specific tasks. 
For example, a chatbot can be employed as a helpdesk executive. 
The first chatbot was created by Joseph Wiesenbaum in 1966, named Eliza. 
It all started when Alan Turing published an article named “Computer Machinery and Intelligence”, 
and raised an intriguing question, “Can machine think?”, and ever since, we have seen multiple chatbots surpassing their 
predecessors to be more naturally conversant and technologically advanced. 
These advancements have led us to an era where conversations with chatbots have 
become as normal and natural as with another human.
